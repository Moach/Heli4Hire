Title:   Arma2 Animation Viewer

Author:  Clayman	<worldofclay@gmx.de>

Version: 1.3a

Date:    07-02-2010


******************************


Description:
This is a small demo mission to let you watch all the ingame unit animations (=moves).
You can sort the moves via different filter options and copy the animation name to the clipboard for use in your own mission.


To use an animation in your mission, put one of the following codes in a script file, a trigger or waypoint:
(For gestures, use the playAction or switchAction commands.)

	UnitName playMove "AnimationName";
	UnitName switchMove "AnimationName";

Note: This will not work in the Init line of an unit!


******************************


Required:
This version of the Animation Viewer is for ARMA2 without Operation Arrowhead.
CBA (Community Base Addons) is also required for the search function:

******************************


Installation:
Copy the AnimViewer.utes folder to your mission folder, e.g.

        \My Documents\ArmA2\missions or 
        \My Documents\ArmA2 Other Profiles\[profile name]\missions

Start up the mission editor on Utes and load the AnimViewer.


******************************


To add the Viewer to your own mission, copy the folder 'AnimationViewer' to your mission folder.
Add this to your 'description.ext':

	#include <AnimationViewer\include.h>

Add this to your 'init.sqf' or the Init line of any unit:

	nil = [] execVM "AnimationViewer\init.sqf";


Note: Don't forget to remove all the above before exporting your mission to SP / MP missions! ;-)


******************************


You can save as many animations as you wish in the 'Saved Animations' ListBox.
When clicking on 'Copy', all the saved animations will be copied to clipboard.
